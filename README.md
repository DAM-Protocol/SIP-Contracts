# dHEDGE :handshake: Superfluid (Super dHEDGE)

â€‹dHEDGE is a one-stop location for managing investment activities on-chain where you can put your capital to work in different strategies based on a transparent track record.

With our Superfluid enabled integration, users of dHEDGE can subscribe to any active pool/fund using Superfluid supported/equivalent supertokens of the underlying tokens which are accepted by the dHEDGE pool. A user just has to start a stream. Tokens are deposited into the dHEDGE pool regularly (in approx 24 hour periods) using keepers (Gelato network keepers for the time being). DHPT (dHEDGE Pool Tokens) are minted after each deposit and these are then available for withdrawal after approx 24 hours for the user.

Furthermore, we provide details to track how much has been streamed/deposited to a dHEDGE pool, how much of your streamed amount is uninvested and how much DHPT (dHEDGE Pool Tokens) you can withdraw from our contracts.

We plan to upgrade/modify contracts to support Superfluid IDA (Instant Distribution Agreement) functionality later. This would enable us to distribute the DHPT minted instantly to the users. We also plan to deploy these contract to Optimism once they gain popularity and are proven to be safe enough.
